Spam Mail Detection Model 

📌 **Project Overview**  
This project implements a spam email classifier using Python, NLP, and machine learning techniques. The model classifies emails as **spam (0)** or **ham (1)** using Logistic Regression and TfidfVectorizer.

🛠️ **Features**  
- Data preprocessing and label encoding  
- Feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer  
- Logistic Regression model training and evaluation  
- Real-time prediction for new emails  

💻 **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLP preprocessing  

⚡ **How to Use**  
1. Open `Spam_Mail_Detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
2. Run the notebook to train the model and test predictions.
